In this Repo one can find a deployment for Kubernetes configuring pods for the following: flask app, mongo db, prometheus, grafana

We are deploying the iac via cloudformation being generated by python aws cdk.
We are creating 2 ec2 instances, one will be used as a kubernetes Master server and the other will be used as a Worker Server.

As a pipeline we are using git actions. With git actions we are replacing some variables in the cdk project/git deployment so one needs to ensure that the below secrets are configured in git:


we are installing node exporter on the server in and setting up the prometheus config file to scrape the metrics from the node exporter port 9100.
Node Exporter exposes node/linux system metrics
We can later create a datasource in grafana app from prometheus in order to visualise the data being collected with the metrics exposed from node exportrer.
We are using a dashboard imported from grafana community to grafana which will help us visualise the data without any manual dashboard creations.
